		<h1>CASE STUDY</h1>

		<div class="introcopy">

			<h2>Flyer Wine</h2>

			<p>A group of friends created a homemade, small batch wine and were encouraged to brand it and sell it online. The goal was to create a strong brand with a story that customers could identify with. We wanted to raise brand awareness and increase sales by creating an online presence. A brand guide was created and Flyer Wine was born.</p>

	<section class="cs-probsol">
		<div class="cs-gray">
			<div class="probsol-left">
				<h3><span class="underline">The Challenge</span></h3>
				<p class="grayp">I was tasked with creating a brand guide, which included the name, logo, color palette, typography, tagline and labeling of the wine. The goal was to understand how other successful brands created their stories and how to build a simple, yet effective E-commerce site.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="cs-white">
			<div class="probsol-right">
				<h3><span class="underline">The Solution</span></h3>
				<p class="whitep">This project began with detailed user research, which informed the Flyer Wine Brand Guide. The guide was used to create a memorable brand with cohesive and consistent messaging. Research indicated that users wanted an uncomplicated way to purchase wine online that they could trust for quality, which provided a good framework for the creation of the site.</p>

				<h3><span class="underline-red">Process</span></h3>
				<p class="processp">Flyer Wine was created with an examination of user research and competitive analysis. From there, user personas and flows, branding, wireframes, mockups and prototypes were created and iterated on until the final design emerged.</p>

				<h4><span class="process-tag">Competitive analysis</span></h4>
				<p>An analysis was completed to evaluate the strategies of Cupcake Wines, the Prisoner Wine company and Cirq Wine along with their strengths and weaknesses. We found a niche area where we could emphasize the homemade, small batch aspect of the wine at a good price point. We wanted to focus on quality while retaining a price point below more expensive wines.</p>

				<h4><span class="process-tag">User Personas</span></h4>
				<p>I created three user personas based on the research, which gave insight into the user’s intentions and goals while also expressing their frustrations. Ruth wants a quicker option to purchase wine rather than going to the store but would also like to trust the quality of brand. Abe typically finds online shopping to be a hassle and would like a simpler experience. Cam enjoys wine but can never tell if the wine he’s ordering online is going to be good.</p>

				<p class="brandingp">Before designing the logo, the color palette and typography was chosen to give the brand a distinct identity. Nova Round was selected for the headlines for its rounded edges, which mirrored the roundness of grapes and also gave the font a vintage feel to keep in line with the brand story. Lora was selected for the body for its balance and readability. The color palette was chosen to reflect the University of Dayton’s color scheme, which is the city the Wright brothers were born in. Blue, Red and Gold gave the brand an elegant scheme while retaining the vintage vibe.</p>

				<h4><span class="process-tag">Logo</span></h4>
				<p>The logo began with pencil and paper and after many hours of trial and error, moved to digital renderings. I paired a minimalistic grape cluster with clean wing designs to retain the simple and vintage theme. The logo is easily scalable and works with multiple color schemes.</p>

				<h4><span class="process-tag">Wireframes</span></h4>
				<p>I created the low-fidelity wireframes and then tested the designs for usability. Once I had the optimized designs, I continued to gather user feedback by utilizing navigation and preference tests. The users felt the site was too crowded so I tweaked the design of the homepage and the product detail page to allow for more space. After the structure of the site was finalized, I moved into high-fidelity mockups.</p>

				<h4><span class="process-tag">Mockups</span></h4>
				<p>The site uses primarily picture based images from the early 1900’s to showcase the vintage theme and story around the Wright brothers first flights and also the story behind the creation of the wine. Additional illustrations were added to the product detail page to highlight the quality of the wine. After adding color and images, I created a clickable prototype on InVision and continued user testing to improve the user experience.</p>

					<p class="three-graph">The results showed that the users were able to view the product details with ease. The cart and checkout process was made simple and straightforward based on user feedback, which created a seamless user experience.</p>
					<p class="three-graph">This project presented a unique challenge as I had never created a brand guide before. A lot of focus was put on building the brand’s story and being able to present a cohesive and clear message across all channels.</p>
					<p class="three-graph">In the end, the brand had a unique and consistent story that differentiated itself from the competitors. The work on the front end unified the brand story with the user experience, which had a positive impact on how users interacted with the brand and the site.</p>
