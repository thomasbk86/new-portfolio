          <p>Saving inspiration on the web can be difficult. Blocmarc wants to give users an easy way to create text and collect images and links so that they&rsquo;ll never forget an idea. I researched, designed and developed this prototype for my Bloc Designer Track project.</p>

          <p>Most web apps for note taking are too complicated &ndash; there are more options than are necessary to record inspiration. The end result is a cluttered experience that makes finding content cumbersome and confusing. Blocmarc strives to give its users a simple, clean and effective way of saving ideas on the web.</p>

          <p>Through comprehensive user research, competitive analysis and user testing, we created Blocmarc: Never forget an idea.

          <p>An analysis of market competitors Evernote, Google Keep and Quip found that Blocmarc&rsquo;s experience should be a sweet spot between Google Keep and Evernote. The intuitive interface and features of Keep combined with some of the Evernote utilities like web clipper could meet that goal without making the app feel bloated.</p>

          <p>Before jumping into the design and layout of the app, we established the overall look and feel of the brand. That included choosing fonts for headlines and body type &ndash; Roboto Slab and Catamaran. Roboto was chosen for its versatility as it has a mechanical skeleton but features friendly and open curves. The hard angles of the font align with boxes and toy building blocks, which give the type face a playful characteristic. We chose this red color scheme mostly to differentiate Blocmarc from its competitors. Evernote is Green, Dropbox is blue and Google Keep is yellow, so we wanted to stay away from those colors.</p>

          <p>Low-fidelity wireframes were created, tested and experienced many different iterations before graduating to the the high-fidelity stage. The first round of testing took place on Peek, where random users were asked to complete a specific set of tasks. A usability test script was then developed and three users completed video usability tests on a clickable prototype. Overall, the three users had a positive response to Blocmarc and were able to navigate the site smoothly. The biggest stumbling block was the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo; button on the My Account page. All three users were confused about where to go to view a summary of their Blocmarc account. So, we fixed that problem by changing the title of the button to &ldquo;My Account.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>After we were satisfied with the architecture of the site, we began the process of bringing Blocmarc to life. The first step was applying color and images to the layout. Computer and design-themed images were used for the backgrounds, and custom illustrations were made for the home page. Next, we built a clickable prototype on inVision that we used for multiple user testing experiments including UserTesting videos, five-second tests, nav tests and preference tests. The biggest discovery through testing was that users weren&rsquo;t finding the &ldquo;add&rdquo; button as quickly as we wanted. So, we transformed the add button into a circle with a &ldquo;+&rdquo; and placed it in the center of the screen. The results from the final nav test showed a 90% success rate:</p>

          <p>Finally, after we were confident in our user experience and interface, we began to build the html, css, javaScript and jQuery for Blocmarc. The building process stayed true to the final iteration of the design. We waded into unfamiliar javaScript territory with the sticky navbar, but through research, trial and error and dogged determination, we found a solution to our coding problems.</p>

            <p class="three-graph">User testing provided crucial feedback for our process. Being able to watch users actually use the site provided valuable insight that we immediately put into action, like the add and account buttons.</p>
            <p class="three-graph">More importantly, we were validated by the positive responses to Blocmarc. Words used during testing like &ldquo;trustworthy,&rdquo; &ldquo;modern,&rdquo; &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; confirmed that our experience was a positive one for users.</p>
